- You come across a group of your followers. Clothed in rags they escape the summer heat by relaxing the fountain

if 1
	- Driven by your empathy you decide to make fountain, rain gold instead of water so that your followers could afford a better clothes... and air conditioning. 
	- Accidentally not only water turned into gold, but people as well... At least the fountain looks nicer now.

if 2-3
	- You try to chill with the people, but do not manage to spark an interesting conversation, considering the fact that you roll the dice before saying anything. Pretty awkward

	- After having a blast swimming in the fountain and chatting with the followers you turn water into liquid gold as an act of divine favor. That's how hobos became millionaires!

	- In the center two men were aggressively insulting each other. 
	- 20 minutes of insults later they finally started fighting. 
	- Shortly  after one of the participants was knocked out. Quite anticlimactic

	- Being bored after rolling the dice for like 1 minute you decide to take a walk. 
	- You approach the market of your followers. Everyone has their personal bucket filled with martini. When people need to buy something they weight the respective buckets, and then transfuse between them. The richest people have entire pools of martini. Unfortunately, being a liquid, martini tends to slowly evaporate. 
	- People are now calling it inflation

if 1-2
